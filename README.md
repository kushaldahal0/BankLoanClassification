# BankLoanClassification
<h1>Task 1: Bank Loan Classification</h1> <br>
    <p> a dataset of the bank loans consisting of 15 columns and a corresponding
 target column. Your task is to build a machine-learning model that can accurately classify
 whether the personal loan was accepted or not based on the information provided.
 Dataset:
 The dataset is provided in a Xlsx file with the following columns and their details:
 ● ID:IDofthe customer
 ● Age:Ageofthe customer
 ● Gender: Mfor Male, F for Female and O for Others
 ● Experience: Amount of work experience in years
 ● Income: Amount of annual income (in thousands)
 ● HomeOwnership: Home Owner, Rent and Home Mortgage.
 ● Zipcode: Postal code in which the client lives
 ● Family: Number of family members
 ● CCAvg:Average monthly spending with the credit card (in thousands)
● Education: Education level (1: bachelor's degree, 2: master's degree, 3:
 advanced/professional degree)
 ● Mortgage: Value of home mortgage, if any (in thousands)

 ● Online: Does the customer use the internet banking facilities?
 ● CreditCard: Does the customer use a credit card issued by the bank?
 ● Personal Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign?

 The trained machine learning model is saved in a format that can be easily loaded and used for
 prediction
  A brief report is also mentioned with the task (1)
   The chatbot interface is made user-friendly and intuitive for seamless interaction.
   Chatbot needs both model and dataset to work properly

<h1>Task 2: OpenCV implementaion</h1>
    <h3>Assign the number (1 to 4) below the image of the rectangle with respect to its length
 inside the rectangle. The shorter the line lower the number (No need to reorder the image of the
 rectangle, only give numbering).</h3>
 <h3> Align(make the rectangle image straight) all the given images of the rectangle.</h3>
